# Daily Note - 2025-01-20

**Mood:** good ðŸ˜Š
**Energy Level:** 7/10

## Today's Focus
- Finish OAuth integration
- Code review for MFA PR
- Team knowledge sharing session

## Morning Routine
- âœ… Team standup
- âœ… Email triage
- âœ… Calendar review
- âœ… Priority setting

## Accomplishments
### OAuth Integration
Successfully completed the OAuth 2.0 integration with Google and GitHub providers. Key achievements:
- Implemented authorization flow
- Added token refresh mechanism
- Created provider abstraction layer
- 95% test coverage

### Code Review
Reviewed Bob's MFA implementation PR. Feedback provided:
- Suggested using time-based OTP library
- Recommended adding backup codes
- Minor refactoring suggestions for cleaner code

### Knowledge Sharing
Led a 30-minute session on OAuth security best practices. Topics covered:
- State parameter importance
- PKCE for public clients
- Token storage strategies
- Common security pitfalls

## Learnings
- Discovered a new debugging technique using VS Code's conditional breakpoints
- Learned about OAuth 2.1 draft specification changes
- Found a useful library for generating QR codes for TOTP

## Challenges
- Spent 2 hours debugging a race condition in token refresh logic
- Needed to refactor callback handling for better error messages

## Gratitude
- Thanks to Carol for helping debug the session issue
- Appreciated Alice's detailed security feedback
- Great team collaboration today

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. Start MFA UI implementation
2. Write integration tests for OAuth flow
3. Documentation for OAuth setup guide
4. 1-on-1 with manager

## Notes & Ideas
- Consider implementing social login analytics
- Explore passwordless authentication options
- Document common OAuth error scenarios
